## System Scaling and Load Balancing

### Context:

The platform is hitting peak traffic during a high-profile auction. Outline your
immediate actions to scale the system and balance the load without downtime.
Discuss your choice of technologies and methods, referencing specific AWS
services and load balancing strategies.

### Components:

- **Scaling Strategies**:

    - **Horizontal Scaling**: This preferred approach involves adding more instances of a service (e.g., bidding engine)
      to
      handle
      increased traffic.
        - **AWS Auto Scaling Groups**: application can leverage AWS Auto Scaling Groups to automatically provision and
          terminate
          instances
          based on predefined metrics like CPU utilization or incoming requests. This ensures resources are available
          when needed
          and costs are optimized during low-traffic periods.
        - **Containerization**: Consider containerizing microservices using Docker or AWS Fargate. This allows for
          faster
          and more
          lightweight deployments, facilitating horizontal scaling.
    - **Vertical Scaling**: While less preferred, vertically scaling involves upgrading existing instances with more
      powerful CPUs
      or memory. This might be appropriate for services with predictable resource requirements (e.g., user service).

--------------

- **Load Balancing Strategies**:

    - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: An AWS service that distributes incoming traffic across healthy instances of
      a
      service.
      It can handle HTTP/HTTPS traffic, making it ideal for web application. The ALB routes requests based on
      predefined policies like round robin or least connections.
    - **Auto Scaling Integration**: The ALB can be integrated with Auto Scaling Groups to automatically scale instances
      based on
      traffic volume. This ensures sufficient capacity to handle peak loads during high-profile auctions.
    - **Health Checks**: The ALB performs health checks on instances to identify and remove unhealthy ones from the
      pool,
      ensuring
      users are directed to functioning services.

------------------

- **Immediate Actions During High Traffic**:

    - **Monitor Key Metrics**: Closely monitor key metrics like CPU utilization, memory usage, and response times for
      all
      services.
    - **Identify Bottlenecks**: Analyze data to pinpoint potential bottlenecks (e.g., overloaded bidding engine).
    - **Horizontal Scaling**: Initiate horizontal scaling for the identified service by adding more instances to the
      Auto
      Scaling
      Group.
    - **ALB Configuration**: Adjust the ALB configuration if necessary to distribute traffic more effectively across
      instances.
    - **Communication**: Proactively communicate with users about potential delays during peak traffic periods.

--------------------

- Additional Considerations:

    - **Caching**: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data (e.g., property details) to reduce database
      load and
      improve response times.
    - **Database Scaling**: Consider database scaling solutions like Amazon RDS Read Replicas to handle increased read
      traffic.
    - **Disaster Recovery**: Implement a disaster recovery plan to ensure service availability in case of unforeseen
      events.
      By implementing these scaling and load balancing strategies, application can ensure its bidding platform remains
      responsive and reliable even during high-traffic periods of high-profile auctions.
