## Hybrid Auctions: Feasibility and Alignment with the application Objectives

### **Feasibility:**

Hybrid auctions, combining online and in-person bidding, are a viable option for application due to several factors:

-  **Target Market**: The Saudi real estate market has a significant segment of users who are comfortable with traditional
   in-person auctions. Hybrid auctions cater to both online-savvy users and those who prefer a physical experience.
-  **Increased Trust and Familiarity**: Offering in-person options can attract users who might be hesitant to participate
   solely online, especially for high-value properties. This can boost overall user base and auction participation.
-  **Government Partnerships**: Partnering with Infath can ensure compliance and potentially facilitate designated locations
   for in-person auctions at government offices or partnered real estate agencies.
-  **Technology Integration**: Leveraging existing online bidding technology, application can seamlessly integrate in-person
   bidding by having participants submit bids electronically at the venue.


### **Alignment with Objectives**:

Hybrid auctions directly align with the application overall objectives in several ways:

-  **Competitive Advantage**: By offering both online and in-person options, application differentiates itself from purely
   online competitors.
-  **Increased User Engagement**: Hybrid auctions can attract a wider range of users, leading to potentially higher bids and
   more active participation.
-  **Enhanced User Experience**: Users have the flexibility to choose their preferred bidding method, catering to diverse
   preferences.
-  **Transparency and Trust**: The in-person component fosters a sense of transparency and trust, especially for users who
   value a physical bidding experience.


### **Conclusion**:

Hybrid auctions are a feasible and strategic approach for application to gain a competitive edge, attract a broader user
base, and increase overall engagement in the platform. By carefully considering implementation details and ensuring a
seamless experience, application can successfully deliver a unique value proposition in the Saudi real estate auction
market.
