### Context:

- Saudi Real-estate businesses traditionally prefer auctions as a buy & sell
  method.
- Online platforms are growing due to the digitization movement and government
  support.
- Approval required from Infath, a Saudi government arm responsible for
  approving online auction platforms.
- Seven companies officially approved by Infath are our direct competition.
- Our client is a conglomerate with core businesses in real-estate, construction
  and financial services. They would like to compete in the online auction
  marketplace space.

### Incumbents:
  Objective: Create a concept for a new bidding platform that stands out in the
  competitive landscape currently dominated by platforms like Soumtech and Saudi
  Auctions.
